 Heart disease is one of the 3 diseases that cause death in the world in 2019. Data shows that cases of heart disease have almost
doubled from 271 million cases in 1990 to 523 million cases in 2019. According to researchers, each country needs to creating cost-effective public
health programs to reduce heart disease risk through behavioral and lifestyle changes. To overcome this, innovation is needed that can determine
whether someone has a high potential to have a heart attack or not. In this case, we utilize machine learning models to carry out early detection and
management in analyzing factors that can trigger heart disease. The logistic regression model is proven to be an effective statistical method in
predicting the probability of a heart attack based on relevant variables. In this system, the logistic regression model is able to provide effective and
efficient information to health workers and patients in identifying risk factors associated with heart attacks.
